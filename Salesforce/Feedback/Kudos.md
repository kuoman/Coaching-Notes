   "I came for an AI workshop and am leaving with insights on how to write better code."

    "Also I want to tell you that your classes gave me a lot of confidence to try this. Also a lot of perspective on how unfamiliar I am with a real development environment, which to me is equally valuable. Thank you for running those classes and please send my appreciation along to Paige as well."

   I'm thankful for this learning opportunity and I'm already eager to learn more!

Beck Weinhold - 2025-05-19 Collab with AI
   This session was eye-opening and the in-person format was invaluable! The topic itself was very helpful since I have been hesitant/skeptical about how to productively incorporate AI into my day-to-day coding and walking through the example gave me some practice in trying to collaborate with an AI assistant rather than feeling like I had to discard whatever it produced. We had some practical lessons in the importance of setting the context and guardrails and hands-on experience figuring out how to get back on track when Cursor strayed from the path we wanted to take. It was also very important to be there in person, all of us trying to get things running at the same time; we could get help directly from Stephen and Paige (they are both fantastic), overhear someone else being helped on the same point we're stuck on, talk to each other about whether it works or not, and realize the similar-but-varied experiences we were having with the same AI and the same set of prompts (with a variety of inputs across our different chats with Cursor). Please support Stephen and Paige in running this session with as many groups/teams *in person* as possible!
